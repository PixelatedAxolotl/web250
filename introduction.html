                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>REL110 - World Religions:</strong> This was one of my options to fulfill some of the
                        liberal arts
                        credits I need and it was offered online.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>WEB250 - Database Driven Websites:</strong> This class looked fun. I like web
                        development,
                        I like databases, and I need some elective credits.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>METR 1102 - Introduction to Meteorology:</strong> I'm taking this at UNC Charlotte to
                        fulfill
                        my science with lab requirement. I picked it because it looked interesting,
                        wasn't chemistry or biology, and worked with my schedule.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>METR 1102L - Introduction to Meteorology Lab:</strong> Required lab that goes with
                        METR 1102.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</strong>
                I like collecting postage stamps, particularly ones with reptile or space themes.

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>I'd also like to Share:</strong>
                The binomial name of the Sandfish Skink is Scincus scincus which I think is funny.
                They got their common name from the way they “swim” under the surface of sand.
