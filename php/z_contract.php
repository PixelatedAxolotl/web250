        <h2>CONTRACT</h2>
        <p>
            I, <a href="introduction.html">Lauren K. Stewart</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract 
            in my Spring 2025, Web 250, Database Driven Websites with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
        </p>
        <p>
            I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the
            world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish 
            to keep private.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for 
            class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it's possible to find many 
            examples online or even view my classmates' code directly. I swear that I will only use these 
            resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit 
            (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
        </p>
